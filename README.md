# Underwater Trash Detection using Yolov8

## Introduction

The "Underwater Trash Detection" project aims to utilize advanced object detection techniques to address the growing environmental issue of underwater pollution. Oceans and waterways are increasingly threatened by the accumulation of trash, which poses significant risks to marine life and ecosystems. Effective monitoring and removal of underwater debris are crucial for preserving aquatic environments.

In this project, we employ the YOLO (You Only Look Once) v8 algorithm, renowned for its speed and accuracy in object detection tasks, to identify and classify various types of underwater trash. The YOLO v8 model is trained on a dataset of underwater images containing different kinds of debris, such as plastic bottles, fishing nets, and other pollutants. By deploying this model, we aim to develop a robust and real-time detection system that can be used in underwater drones and robots to monitor and assist in cleaning operations, thereby contributing to the conservation of marine environments.


## Overview

This project utilizes the Ultralytics YOLO framework, employing a YOLOv8 model for efficient and accurate trash detection. The system captures real-time video from a webcam, processes the footage, and overlays bounding boxes with labels for different types of underwater trash. The goal is to provide a user-friendly solution for early detection and intervention to combat underwater pollution.

## Class Names

The YOLOv8 model is trained to recognize the following classes of underwater trash:

1. **Bottle**: Plastic and glass bottles.
2. **Can**: Metal or aluminum cans.
3. **Plastic Bag**: Plastic bags that pose a threat to marine life.
4. **Waste**: General waste items contributing to underwater pollution.

## Conclusion

The "Underwater Trash Detection" project successfully demonstrates the application of the YOLO v8 algorithm to tackle the pressing issue of underwater pollution. By leveraging the capabilities of YOLO v8, the project achieved high accuracy in detecting various types of underwater debris, providing a valuable tool for environmental monitoring and cleanup efforts.

The performance of the YOLO v8 model, as evidenced by the provided results and visualizations, highlights its potential for real-world application in marine conservation initiatives. Implementing this technology in underwater drones and robots can significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of trash detection and removal operations, thereby helping to protect marine ecosystems and biodiversity.

Future work could involve expanding the dataset to include a wider variety of underwater environments and debris types, as well as improving the model's robustness under different lighting and water conditions. Additionally, integrating the detection system with real-time navigation and cleanup mechanisms could further enhance its practical utility.

Overall, this project underscores the potential of advanced object detection algorithms like YOLO v8 to transform environmental conservation efforts, offering innovative solutions for preserving the health and sustainability of our oceans and waterways.
